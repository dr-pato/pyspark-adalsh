# Spark Adaptive LSH
Top-K Entity Resolution for [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/). The algorithm is described in the paper "Top-K Entity Resolution with Adaptive Locality-Sensitive Hashing" of Vasilis Verroios and Hector Garcia-Molina of Stanford University, available [here](http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/1149/1/topKERtechrep.pdf).
Some of code of Adaptive LSH is based on [pyspark-lsh project](https://github.com/dr-pato/pyspark-lsh), an implementation of the classic LSH tecnique.
